# Introduction to the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)

- What is the Standard Library

    The standard library of a language is a collection of built in tools you most likely want to use sometimes but not every time you write a program.<sup>[1](https://dev.to/sloan/explain-like-im-five-whats-a-standard-library-4gi)</sup>

    The Python Standard Library is a collection of modules distributed with the language that provides tooling to help remove the need to rewrite common task, expand on built ins, and assist in ineracting with the OS, interpreter and varios other systems.

    Python Enhancement Proposals a.k.a [PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)

    What is a PEP? - [PEP 1](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/)
    ```
    PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. 

    A PEP is a design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment. 
    The PEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

    We intend PEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, 
    and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. 

    The PEP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
